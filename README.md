# Capital at risk framework or credit risk model

Built a credit risk model on dataset of Indian companies to predict the probability of default 
using logistic regression framework. Information package in R was used to perform variable screening 
and exploratory analysis with WOE and IV. Stepwise Logistic regression model technique was used to
build the model by first building the model using all the important variables and then removing most 
insignificant variable at each step.
